Project Description ðŸ“„
In this ongoing assignment, we'll experience what it's like to work as a web developer, building a website from the ground up using HTML and CSS. This project will guide us through the process of creating and styling a professional website, reinforcing your understanding of the foundational concepts of web development.

Throughout this assignment, we'll be tasked with building different sections of a website, each designed to introduce new HTML and CSS concepts. Weâ€™ll start with the basic structure using HTML, and as we progress, weâ€™ll enhance the siteâ€™s design and functionality with various CSS techniques and frameworks.
